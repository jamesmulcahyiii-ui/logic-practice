# Logic Practice & Sovereign Metrics
This repository serves as a technical sandbox for mastering algorithmic patterns and tracking autonomy metrics.

## Current Projects
* **Runway Calculator:** A Python tool for calculating net burn rate and "Sovereign Autonomy" windows based on liquidity and income.
* **Seating Chart (Upcoming):** An implementation of the "Two Sum" pattern using optimized hash maps.

## Technical Goals
- [x] Establish a cloud-based Python execution environment (GitHub Codespaces).
- [x] Build a functional financial stress-test script.
- [ ] Master O(n) time complexity solutions for search patterns.# logic-practice
